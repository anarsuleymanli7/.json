A hierarchical document schema is used to define data entities (objects) that have multiple attributes.

JSON is just one of many ways in which semi-structured data can be represented.

This repository is dedicated to the JSON code samples.

The point here is not to provide a detailed examination of JSON syntax.

The illustration of flexible nature of semi-structured data representations is shown in these files.
